The second will test the hypothesis that, in the model, the average reading time is monotonically dependent on the relative harmony values of two competing peaks.\n",

    "The time to travel some distance along a curve $C$ is equal to the distance traveled divided by the speed of travel. Thus, we're looking for an equation of the form $T = dist / speed$. In the general case of $n$-dimensions, this will be a path integral $T = \\int_C \\mathbf{F}~ds$, where $\\mathbf{F}$ is some vector field and $ds$ is infinitesimally small arc length along the curve $C$. Ideally, we would define the curve $C$ to be the actual path defined by the dynamics, but that would require an explicit solution to the differential equation $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\nabla H(\\mathbf{x})$, which we don't have. Instead, we approximate the actual solution curve with a straight line connecting the initial state $\\mathbf{x}_0$ and some final state $\\mathbf{x}_1$ close to $\\mathbf{x}_g$ or $\\mathbf{x}_u$.\n",
